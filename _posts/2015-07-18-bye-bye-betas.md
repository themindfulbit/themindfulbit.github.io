[Here's another excellent post](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/07/bye-bye-betas/) by [Dr. Drang](http://twitter.com/drdrang) on the responsibilities of a beta tester. 

> It’s kind of cool to be running a beta app, but there’s a responsibility, too. A responsibility I can’t live up to anymore. I just don’t have time to put into writing good bug reports.

I particularly liked this line:

> I’ve never been burned by using a beta, but then I’ve never installed a beta of iOS or OS X.

It reminds me of that time a week ago when Bob uninstalled all his iOS and OS X betas for the fifth year in a row and shipped his Apple Watch back to Apple so they could wipe it saying,

"This is the last time I install a beta until next year."

Good times.
