[Tommaso Dorigo](http://twitter.com/dorigo) is an experimental particle physicist working on the [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Muon_Solenoid) experiment at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). His [blog](http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor) is an excellent resource if you're interested in the LHC in particular and physics in general.

On Friday Tommaso posted [this interesting piece](http://www.science20.com/a_quantum_diaries_survivor/bang_meet_the_highestenergy_hadron_collision_ever_imaged-156726) about an unusually high-energy collision event in their early runs at the LHC's newly increased power level:

> The two jets have a combined invariant mass of 5.0 TeV, which is an extremely rare occurrence even for a 13 TeV collision - in fact, just one such event was collected so far, out of several trillion collisions. Such a feature can be produced by a very heavy particle (like, say, 5 TeV) which decays into a quark-antiquark pair. If such a thing does exist, that is. Or less excitingly, by a very rare scattering of two quarks or gluons in the two colliding objects.

I can't wait to see if anything (or nothing for that matter) comes from the next round of experiments at LHC.
