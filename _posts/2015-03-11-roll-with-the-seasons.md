[John Chidgey](http://twitter.com/johnchidgey) was kind enough to invite me on his outstanding podcast [Pragmatic](http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-59-roll-with-the-seasons) a couple of weeks ago.

We talked mostly about change &ndash; specifically the changes that come when you begin hobbies and end them, when hobbies turn into work, and whether or not work can become as enjoyable as a hobby. Along the way we talked a little about my experiences flying in the Navy and also a bit about the challenges of podcasting as a hobby, a job, and a listener.

John recently announced that he's [stepping back](http://techdistortion.com/articles/setting-the-bar-high) from Pragmatic for a little while. As a listener that makes me sad, but as a podcast producer I find it completely understandable.

One quick note about the title: It's a play on [Potatowire's](http://twitter.com/potatowire) *Seasons of Obsession* concept that we discussed on [Dawn Patrol](http://technicaldifficulties.us/dawn-patrol), most notably during [Episode 011 - The Collector Gene](http://technicaldifficulties.us/dawn-patrol/011-the-collector-gene).
