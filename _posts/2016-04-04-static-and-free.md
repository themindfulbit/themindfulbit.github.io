Eddie Smith discusses moving his blog [Practically Efficient](http://www.practicallyefficient.com) from Squarespace to Github-hosted Jekyll:

> My time with Squarespace ended today. It was never an entirely happy marriage between us, and it’s not worth spilling every detail why, but I will say that the main thing that ultimately drove me from Squarespace for good was its poorly implemented Markdown editor.

While we're here, don't forget to update your RSS reader to his new feed:

[Eddie's](https://twitter.com/eddie_smith) clear explanation of the process and his reasoning behind the change are well worth reading. They mirror my experience closely.

For those who don't have strong feelings about *how* their blog works, Squarespace can be a great solution. Those of us who are a little more finicky about design, format, and ownership are doomed to wander the wastes looking for our own answers.

There are many options, and Eddie chose an excellent one.
