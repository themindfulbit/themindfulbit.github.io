Apparently someone at Fitbit was listening to us [the other day](http://high90.pub/high90cast/001-wearables).

In a [recent press release](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150323005264/en/Fitbit-Releases-Outdoor-Bike-Tracking-Fitbit-Surge-Comprehensive#.VRKrZoWCOn), Fitbit announced an upcoming software update with some major improvements:

> This week, Fitbit will also launch Multi-Tracker Support, which lets users seamlessly switch between Fitbit trackers throughout their day or week, so they can use the right tracker for any occasion. Users will now be able to pair up to six Fitbit trackers (one of each model) and MobileTrack (iOS only) to a single Fitbit account:
> 
> * Once multiple trackers are paired to an account, Fitbit will automatically detect when a user switches from one tracker to another, with no buttons to push on the device or the app
> * For users who want to wear a more discreet Fitbit One to work, Fitbit Surge for a run, or Tory Burch for Fitbit for a night on the town, all of their steps will be seamlessly captured on their Fitbit dashboard
> * Users with a compatible mobile device can also utilize MobileTrack as a tracker to fill in the gaps if they leave their tracker at home or forget to charge it

In addition, it looks like support for cycling on the Surge is being added next month, which will also be welcome.

Multi-device and native phone-based motion sensor support have been on my wish list for a while, and the reduced battery life of their latest trackers didn't make that any less necessary. You've got to charge sometime.

I don't see the Apple Watch or Android Wear as necessarily an existential threat to Fitbit as long as they continue to move in the direction of compatibility. Any attempt to lock their users into a closed ecosystem will just drive them away faster. 

In the wearable space, people want to wear what they want to wear. Fitbit can choose to ride this wave of fashion fickleness or drown in it. This is a step in the right direction.
